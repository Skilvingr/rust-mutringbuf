#[doc = r##"
Iterator used to push data into the buffer.

When working with types which implement both
[`Copy`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html) and
[`Clone`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html) traits, `copy` methods should be
preferred over `clone` methods.

# TL;DR about uninitialised memory
If you created the buffer with either `default` or `from` methods and you are *not* going to use [`ConsIter::pop`],
then it is safe to use normal methods from this struct.

If you either created the buffer with `new_zeroed` or are going to move items out of the buffer (e.g. using [`ConsIter::pop`]),
then you must pay attention to what you do and ensure that all the locations cleared by `pop` will be re-filled with `*_init` methods.
After that you can use normal methods again.
Read below to know why and how.

It would be a good idea to do a check with [miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri), which is able to
tell if and when something bad has happened.

# A note about how this buffer is made:
Every element in this buffer is wrapped in an [`UnsafeSyncCell`], which in the end is a [`MaybeUninit`].
`MaybeUninit` (read the official docs if you want to know more) is a way to deal with possibly uninitialised data.

When one creates a buffer from this crate, they may choose to build it either with `default` and `from` methods,
or with `new_zeroed` ones.

When using the former, an initialised buffer is created, so there are no problems concerning uninitialised memory.
With the latter methods, a zeroed buffer is rather created.
To write data into an uninitialised (or zeroed) block of memory, one has to use [`write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.write)
method, which overwrites a memory location, without reading or dropping the old value.

Remember that a zeroed location must *never* be read or dropped. Doing so would cause UB!

On the other hand, using `write` on an initialised block doesn't drop the old value, causing then a memory leak.

For each of the methods in this struct, there exists a `*_init` one (e.g. [`Self::push`] and [`Self::push_init`]).
Normal methods are faster than `*_init` ones, and should be preferred over these when dealing with *surely*
initialised memory.

On the other hand, `*_init methods` always perform a check over the memory they are going to write and choose the proper way to
deal it, even dropping the old value, if there is the need. So they are safe to use upon a possibly uninitialised block.
